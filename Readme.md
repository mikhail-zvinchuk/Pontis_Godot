## 🛠️ Installation

This should just work in godot by opening project.godot. 

## ❓ Questions 
More of issues then questions in this repo:
- Project was stopped because it appared that desired WebGL effects are not supported in current version of godot. 
- I didn't find GD Script particularly fun to work with. 
- You can't use C# with Godot 4 for webbuilds.
- I'm hoping to remake this game in unity, since it seems that it is the current goto for Web based games.
